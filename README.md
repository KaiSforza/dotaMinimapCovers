# Minimap Covers for Streamers

These PNG images are copies of the Dota 7.00 minimap. It's just the minimap,
no custom skin or anything on top of it, so positioning it is key. From the
bottom and side the cover should be:

* 1080p normal: 8 pixels
* 1080p large: 10 pixels
* 1440p large: 13 pixels

from the edge. This should exactly match the minimap position in game. How
you position this will be different depending on your streaming software.

If anyone has other sizes they want added or using the other mini-map style,
then please send me a bug report or pull request.
