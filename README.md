# Minimap Covers for Streamers

These PNG images are copies of the Dota 7.00 minimap. It's the full minimap,
including the border around it, so it will cover up some HUD skins. These
should be placed directly in the corner (Bottom left or bottom right) of the
stream scene, to cover the minimap.

If anyone has other sizes they want added or using the other mini-map style,
then please send me a bug report or pull request.

## Example with destroyed tower

## Example OBS Item Transform Dialog

![Replace the 1440 with 1080 or whatever your vertical resolution
is](exampleImages/Transform.png)
